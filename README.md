# Automate My Life

> This is a Rails 5.1 (with Webpacker and Angular2) for a mobile-responsive web application that will hopefully automate my life. I'm going to use this with my partner to sync on chores and other duties.

My plans include:

* Twilio SMS notification when a button is pressed
* ActionCable Chat for daily notifications
* Shopping list (and probably a generalised ToDo list)
* Integration with [Atrato](https://github.com/atratobris) to manage our smart devices
